        <h2>Athena :: Greek Goddess of Wisdom and War</h2>
        <p id="p1">
            Athena is the Olympian goddess of wisdom and war 
            and the adored patroness of the city of Athens. 
            A virgin deity, she was also – somewhat paradoxically 
            – associated with peace and handicrafts, especially 
            spinning and weaving. Majestic and stern, Athena 
            surpassed everybody in both of her main domains. 
            In fact, even Ares feared her; and all Greek heroes 
            asked her for help and advice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Athena’s name is closely linked with the name of 
            the city of Athens. The Ancient Greeks debated whether 
            she got her name after the city or the other way around. 
            Modern scholars usually agree that the former was the 
            case.
        </p>
        <h2>Ares :: Greek God of War</h2>
        <p>
            Ares is the Olympian god of war. However, unlike Athena, 
            he represents merely its destructive capacity and is 
            typically the personification of sheer violence and 
            brutality. Consequently, he was loved neither by gods 
            nor by men. That is, with the exception of Aphrodite, 
            who bore him many children out of wedlock.
        </p>
        <p>
            In art, Ares is usually represented wearing a helmet, 
            a shield and either a sword or a spear. He drives a 
            four-horse chariot and is accompanied by dogs or vultures. 
            Sometimes, his sons Deimos and Phobos are also depicted 
            beside him.
        </p>
